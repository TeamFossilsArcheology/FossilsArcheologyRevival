Dicranurus (Die-cran-urr-us) is one of the most bizarre trilobites, even among its family odontopleuridae, which contains some real weirdos. Its body segments are elongated at the sides into fearsome spikes, with two large spines coming out of its cheeks – the strangest feature, however, are the two curved horns which extend from the back of the glabella. While these spines may have been intimidating at the bottom of the sea covering Oklahoma during the Devonian, Dicranurus is only about two inches long. Interestingly, this trilobite was used as an initial inspiration for an alien design for a particular film released in 2012, so perhaps these spines do have some merit in being scary! Don’t worry though – this Dicranurus won’t be attacking people or laying eggs in their chest any time soon.
