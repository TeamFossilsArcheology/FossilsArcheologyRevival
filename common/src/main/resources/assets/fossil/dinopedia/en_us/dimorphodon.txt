Dimorphodon (dy-mor-fo-don) was a small pterosaur that lived in the Early Jurassic. Its name means “two-formed teeth” in reference to its heterodont dentition, or multiple types of teeth in its mouth. While common in mammals, this is generally rare in reptiles. While definitively a carnivore, there was some debate in the past as to what types of animals this pterosaur was eating. Tooth microwear analysis suggests a diet of primarily vertebrates such as other reptiles. When compared to Quetzalcoatlus and Pteranodon, Dimorphodon would appear quite primitive, sporting a long tail, short neck, and toothy mouth. It helps to keep in mind that Dimorphodon existed 120 million years before these larger, more derived pterosaurs. Modern reconstructions of Dimorphodon’s locomotion suggest it was particularly able on the ground, more so than many later pterosaurs. Coupled with its shorter wings, this may suggest Dimorphodon spent a lot of time on the ground, and took quick flights rather than soaring for long distances. This pterosaur was also likely a good climber! Hailing from the Jurassic Coast of England, Dimorphodon may have inhabited coastal forests. In the same rocks that yield its fossils, we find fossils of the shark Hybodus, Ichthyosaurus, and Plesiosaurus. No wonder it was initially thought of as a seafarer!
