Scotoharps (Sko-toe-harp-ees) is a small Harpetid trilobite with a near-global range – this species in particular, Scotoharpes spasski comes from the Mid-Ordovician of Russia. Like many of its relatives, Scotoharpes is best known for large brim around their cephalon, or head, which may have served a role in feeding. Perhaps they were using this cephalon to dig through mud, passing particulates through their gills to catch small pieces of food. Its also possible this cephalon may have been used for defense or even combat between individuals, similarly to modern invertebrates. The small eyes of Scotoharpes mean it might not have relied too much on sight, and instead felt the world around it using its antenna. Outside of this, very little is known about the Harpetid trilobites – perhaps now that you have brought one back, you can help fill some gaps in the research?
