Walliserops (Wall-eye-ser-ops) is a unique phacopid trilobite, best known for the three-pronged horn at the front of its head. This species, Walliserops trifurcatus, is known from the Devonian of Morocco, a place renowned for its amazingly detailed trilobite fossils. The “trident” of Walliserops is a protrusion of its glabella, a round feature found on the cephalon, or head, of trilobites, and likely worked just like a real trident – as a weapon. Similar to rhinoceros beetles, it is believed Walliserops would use this trident to joust with others of their species, perhaps with the goal of flipping their opponent over to secure victory and probable mating rights. It is possible this horn is sexually dimorphic, with two different shapes being shown in the fossil record, but this is difficult to prove. Suffice to say, Walliserops is one of the most unique trilobites and, now that you have one swimming around, it is sure to be a prized attraction!
